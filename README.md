RECLAC Python
==============

The RECLAC Python package provides functions to compute **recurrence lacunarity** as described in [[braun2021] (Open Source)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-021-06457-5#article-info). Its functionality is very basic at the current stage and will probably be extended in the near future. It also offers a basic implementation for the computation of recurrence plots and the box-counting dimension.
